Description: Estimates the standard and weighted Elo (WElo, Angelini et al., 2021 <doi:10.1016/j.ejor.2021.04.011>) rates. The current version provides these rates for tennis. In the future, new sports will be added. The 'welo' package offers a flexible tool to estimate the WElo and Elo rates, according to different systems of weights (games or sets) and scale factors (constant, proportional to the number of matches, with more weight on Grand Slam matches or on matches played on a specific surface). Moreover, the package gives the possibility of estimating the (bootstrap) standard errors for the rates. Finally, the package includes a betting function which automatically selects the matches on which place a bet.
